### Summary

Alberta is a western province of Canada. With an estimated population of 4,196,457 as of July 1, 2015, it is Canada's fourth-most populous province and the most populous of Canada's three prairie provinces. Its area is about 660,000 square kilometres (250,000 sq mi). Alberta and its neighbour Saskatchewan were districts of the Northwest Territories until they were established as provinces on September 1, 1905. The premier has been Rachel Notley since May 2015.

Alberta's capital, Edmonton, is near the geographic centre of the province and is the primary supply and service hub for Canada's crude oil, oil sands (Athabasca oil sands) and other northern resource industries.

About 290 km (180 mi) south of the capital is Calgary, the largest city in Alberta. Calgary and Edmonton centre Alberta's two census metropolitan areas, both of which have populations exceeding one million,[9] while the province has 16 census agglomerations. Tourist destinations in the province include Banff, Canmore, Drumheller, Jasper and Sylvan Lake.

In the 2011 census, the City of Calgary had a population of 1,096,833 and a metropolitan population of 1,214,839, making it the largest city in Alberta, and the third-largest municipality and fifth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada.

The economy of Calgary includes activity in the energy, financial services, film and television, transportation and logistics, technology, manufacturing, aerospace, health and wellness, retail, and tourism sectors.[11] The Calgary CMA is home to the second-highest number of corporate head offices in Canada among the country's 800 largest corporations.")

It has played a significant role in the development of the national petroleum industry. A severe wildfire in May 2016 led to the evacuation of its residents and caused widespread damage.

Formerly a city, Fort McMurray became an urban service area when it amalgamated with Improvement District No. 143 on April 1, 1995, to create the Municipality of Wood Buffalo (renamed the RM of Wood Buffalo on August 14, 1996).[14] Despite its current official designation of urban service area, many locals, politicians and the media still refer to Fort McMurray as a city. Fort McMurray was known simply as McMurray between 1947 and 1962.")

The city is surrounded by the County of Grande Prairie No. 1.

Grande Prairie is the seventh-largest city in Alberta with a population of 55,032 recorded by the 2011 Census,[4] and was one of Canada's fastest growing cities between 2001 and 2006.[8]

The city adopted the trumpeter swan as an official symbol due to its proximity to the migration route and summer nesting grounds of this bird. For that reason, Grande Prairie is sometimes nicknamed the \"Swan City\". The dinosaur has emerged as an unofficial symbol of the city due to paleontology discoveries in the areas north and west of the Grande Prairie.")
# Tourism

Wildlife is abundant here, with grizzly bears, black bears, wolves, caribou, and elk, many of which are frequently sighted along the main highway through the park.

Hiking is one of the main summer activities in Banff and there are many frontcountry and backcountry trails to choose from. However, many people explore the park from the comfort of their car, stopping at the numerous roadside lookouts that offer impressive views over the mountains, lakes, and glaciers.")

The study found GDP per capita in the corridor is 10% above average U.S. metropolitan areas and 40% above other Canadian cities. Much of this is because of large oil revenues.")

A walkway runs along the shoreline allowing visitors a lovely place for a leisurely stroll to absorb the atmosphere. Canoe rentals are also available for those who want to paddle out on the lake. From the lakeside path, there are popular hiking trails leading either up the mountain side or beyond the lake towards the glacier.")

m <- addMarkers(m, lng=-117.18, lat=52.09, popup="The Icefields Parkway runs from Lake Louise to Jasper and is one of the most beautiful drives in Canada. This 230-kilometer stretch of highway leads past lakes, mountains, glaciers, and waterfalls, with all kinds of stopping points for visitors to experience the landscape up close. Numerous hiking trails along the way, most of which are day hikes, lead to scenic lookouts over surrounding glaciers or lakes.

One of the main attractions along the Icefields Parkway is the Icefields Centre. This large visitor's center features excellent displays on the Columbia Icefields and looks out over the Athabasca Glacier. From the road, it is difficult to comprehend the layout and size of the icefields, but models and photos at the center offer a unique perspective. Across from the center, it's possible to walk up to the toe of the glacier. Alternatively, tours in specially outfitted buses are available, which drive visitors out onto the glacier. One of the newest attractions is the Glacier Skywalk, a huge observation platform standing 280 meters above the valley below, with a glass floor and glass railings.

It was for many years the location of the image on the reverse side of the old Canadian twenty dollar bill.

Moraine Lake is overshadowed by ten peaks, each more than 3,000 meters high, containing the Wenkchemna Glacier.

It is an area of lakes, waterfalls, mountains, glaciers, and forests, but has a slightly different appearance than the parks and natural areas further south. Both the park and the town of Jasper are less visited than Banff and have a more remote feel, particularly in winter when many facilities in the area are closed. Unlike Banff, the town of Jasper sees very few tourists outside of the peak summer season giving it a much more seasonal character.

Some of the key highlights in Jasper National Park are Maligne Lake, which is frequently pictured in advertisements for the Canadian Rockies, Mount Edith Cavell with the stunning Angel Glacier, and Maligne Canyon. Hiking trails and scenic lookouts can be found throughout the park. In winter, locals enjoy the Marmot Basin Ski Resort.")

Peter Lougheed Provincial Park is one of the main highlights of Kananaskis, particularly for those who want to spend some time immersed in nature. The park forms the very heart of the Kananaskis region where elk, bighorn sheep, mountain-goats, grizzly bears, and black bears roam free. It covers 508 square kilometers, which makes it the largest provincial park in Alberta.

### Stuff {.no-title}

Alberta's economy is the sum of all economic activity in Alberta, Canada's fourth largest province by population. Although Alberta has a presence in many industries such as agriculture, forestry, education, tourism, finance, and manufacturing, the politics and culture of the province have been closely tied to the production of fossil energy since the 1940s. Alberta-with an estimated 1.4 billion cubic metres of unconventional oil resource in the bituminous oil sands-leads Canada as an oil producer

From 1990 to 2003, Alberta's economy grew by 57% compared to 43% for all of Canada-the strongest economic growth of any region in Canada.

### Text Commentary {.no-title}

**Growth**

Alberta has experienced a relatively high rate of growth in recent years,[when?] mainly because of its burgeoning economy. Between 2003 and 2004, the province had high birthrates (on par with some larger provinces such as British Columbia), relatively high immigration, and a high rate of interprovincial migration compared to other provinces.[42]

**Diversity**

Alberta has considerable ethnic diversity. In line with the rest of Canada, many immigrants originated from England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales and France, but large numbers also came from other parts of Europe, notably Germany, Ukraine and Scandinavia.[48] According to Statistics Canada, Alberta is home to the second highest proportion (two percent) of Francophones in western Canada (after Manitoba). Despite this, relatively few Albertans claim French as their mother tongue. Many of Alberta's French-speaking residents live in the central and northwestern regions of the province.

Alberta is the third most diverse province in terms of visible minorities after British Columbia and Ontario with 13.9% of the population consisting of visible minorities.[50] Nearly one-fourth of the populations of Calgary and Edmonton belong to a visible minority group.[51]
