"Notes: Starting with the 2011 Census, the term 'population centre' replaces the term 'urban area. For more information, please see the note titled, From urban areas to population centres, available on our website, explains the new terminology and classification of population centres. The rural population for 1981 to 2011 refers to persons living outside centres with a population of 1,000 AND outside areas with 400 persons per square kilometre. Previous to 1981, the definitions differed slightly but consistently referred to populations outside centres of 1,000 population. Source: Statistics Canada, 2011 Census of Population.
