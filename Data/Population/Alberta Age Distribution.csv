1,Postcensal estimates are based on the 2011 Census counts adjusted for census net undercoverage (CNU) (including adjustment for incompletely enumerated Indian reserves (IEIR)) and the components of demographic growth that occurred since that census. Intercensal estimates are produced using counts from two consecutive censuses adjusted for CNU (including (IEIR) and postcensal estimates.
2,"Estimates are final intercensal up to 2010, final postcensal for 2011 and 2012, updated postcensal from 2013 to 2015 and preliminary postcensal for 2016."
5,Age at last birthday in years.
6,Data for persons aged 90 to 100 years and over will be available from 2001.
7,"The population growth, which is used to calculate population estimates, is comprised of the natural growth (CANSIM 51-0002 and 51-0013), international migration (CANSIM 51-0011) and interprovincial migration (CANSIM 51-0012)."
