The data for the period 1997 to 2006 have been aligned with those published on November 10, 2015 for the period 2007 to 2014. In addition, the chained (2007) dollars for the provincial and territorial GDP for the following three aggregates were revised for the period 2007-2014 vis--vis those released on November 10, 2015: information and communication technology-total, information and communication technology-manufacturing, and information and communication technology-services. The growth rates for these three series for the 2008-2014 period were unaffected."
